# 🖥️ Logbook 1: Installation of Windows Server 2022 using Oracle VirtualBox

## 🎯 Aim
To install and configure Microsoft Windows Server 2022 on a virtual machine using Oracle VirtualBox for learning and testing server features in a virtualized environment.

---

## 📑 Objectives
- To create and configure a virtual machine using Oracle VirtualBox.  
- To install Microsoft Windows Server 2022 on a virtual environment.  
- To perform initial setup such as setting the Administrator password and network configuration.  
- To verify successful installation and understand the concept of virtualization.

## 🧰 Required Tools and Materials

### Software Requirements
- **Oracle VirtualBox** – used to create and manage the virtual machine.  
- **Windows Server 2022 ISO file** – operating system installation image.  
- **Installation Media** – DVD, USB drive, or network boot.  
- **Partition Scheme** – MBR or GPT.  
- **Edition** – Windows Server 2022 Standard or Datacenter.  
- **License Key** – for activation and post-install setup.

### Hardware Requirements
- **Processor** – 64-bit, 2 GHz or faster.  
- **RAM** – Minimum 4 GB (recommended 8 GB or more).  
- **Storage** – 256 GB SSD / 1 TB HDD.  
- **Network Adapter** – 1 Gbps Ethernet adapter.  
- **Display** – 1024×768 or higher resolution monitor.
